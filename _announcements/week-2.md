## Thursday 7/18

To make up for last week’s cancellation of Thursday engagement, we’ll be taking a special field trip to the General Motors (GM) Charlotte Technical Center. GM is one of the world’s largest and most influential automobile manufacturers. This visit will offer a firsthand look at their state-of-the-art automotive engineering and production processes. Furthermore, the GM Charlotte Technical Center is a big part of NASCAR’s operations in the area when it comes to designing, testing, and training drivers on vehicles. At least one member of the planning team has visited the site before, and they have nothing but great things to say about how impressive the building is. It’ll be a blast!

**Importantly, before the field trip, please scan the QR code below to watch a mandatory safety video about GM’s facilities (you must do this!).**
