## Thursday 8/1

This will be the last day of the program, running from **10 AM - 3 PM in-person at the Microsoft Charlotte office. Dress business casual**. We'll have a photographer on site to take professional headshot photos of all students. After that, we'll have our final group coding challenge (with the winning team receiving prizes), some review of how you can stay connected with Microsoft, and a final fun activity to send things off.
