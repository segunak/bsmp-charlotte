# Homework

This page contains the homework for the program. If you get any emails telling you about other homework assignments, you can ignore them. For Charlotte students, this page serves as the one-stop-shop for any homework you'll need to complete. If it's not listed here, you don't have to do it!

## Week 2 (7/16-7/18)

Over the weekend, here's what you should be working on.

1. Complete Visual Studio Code for Education's "Getting Started" course linked below. It'll teach you the basics of the platform and how you can use it to advance your coding skills! On the course page, after clicking "Start Course", sign in with your `@bamsummer.org` account. If you run into issues, you may also sign in with your personal Microsoft account, as either way will get you to the content.

2. Start on Visual Studio Code for Education's "Intro to Python" course linked below. If you have a background with coding, the beginning content might seem repetitive, but we promise it gets more challenging and informative as you continue! This is a self-paced course, so feel free to advance
